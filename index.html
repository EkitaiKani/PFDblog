                    We have created another Github page for the website which will be using ASP .Net Core MVC.

                    The python programme from week 1 has been updated and an encoder has been coded. The encoder converts images from BGR to RGB 
                    and stores them into a file, which is then used to verify known faces.

                        From what I understand, the scrum framework and agile methodology has heavy emphasis on transparency, and therefore 
                        requires both parties, the developers and the stakeholders, to communicate and set the deliverables of a project.
                        <br>

                        As my class has yet to meet our sponsors, using the scrum framework and agile methodology is not very 
                        effective as we do not communicate with them. This leaves us with no choice but to follow the waterfall methodology
                        and try our best to create a prototype before meeting our sponsors, and slowly improve our solution from there.

                <h2>Project development
                    <br><br>
                    My group has come up with a name for our solution: FBEye. 
                    It is a pun with the intention of comparing our software to the FBI. 
                    Similar to the FBI, our solution monitors people who attempt to enter the company building, so we thought it was a suitable name. <br>
                    <br>
                    We have created an Inception Deck slide to introduce our pitch to our sponsors, AIDC Pte Ltd.
                    As I thought the Inception Deck slides template was too plain, I collaborated with my team to use a different slides template.

                        I think it is very important to understand our stakeholders and their positions before pitching an idea to them. 
                        This allows for the business interaction to go smoothly and also allows me to better communicate with the sponsor.
                        <br>
                        Therefore, I decided to put together a list of items, as well as a vague description of AIDC Pte Ltd, 
                        to better understand the whole scope of the project, as well as get familiar with the sponsor to better cater to them
                        during the pitch.

                Currently, my group is working towards creating a facial recognition software to aid AIDC in collecting data, 
                allowing employees' attendance to be recorded without much hassle.
                <br>
                We are in the early phases of development and are still deciding on whether we want to implement Cloud Architecture into our solution. 
                Currently, we have created a Github repository and are coding in Python (cv2) to create our software.
